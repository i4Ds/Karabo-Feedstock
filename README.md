# Karabo-Feedstock

This repository builds the conda-dependencies for the [Karabo pipeline](https://github.com/i4Ds/Karabo-Pipeline) so that a conda-wheel of the pipeline can be built. To do this, the individual packages must be triggered by dependency workflows, which orchestrate other workflows located in this repository. There are two different kind of builds to consider: *main* & *dev* builds. A lot can go wrong if the build-recipe(s) are not correctly configured. You may want to read [conda knowledge-base](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base.html) and [conda-build doc](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/concepts/recipe.html) first before changing anything in the feedstock. 

**Note**: The builds of the feedstock are from 3th party repositories or forked repositories to make them compatible with the Karabo pipeline. This means that the respective builds may not have correct dpendency resolvements because we cannot test this properly. So the main goal is to make sure that the builds related to a Karabo installation have a correct dependency resolvement. If the constraints of a build are too tight or too loose, we can correct this. We ask to open an issue in such a case.

**Important**: DON'T TRIGGER ANY WORKFLOW HERE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!!! If you don't know what you're doing, you could disturb active conda-wheels and make an installation of karabo and it's dependency buggy or even impossible.

## Main builds
Main builds are Conda wheels which are needed for a Karabo build. These packages should have the `main` label, so that they can be installed without additional referencing of another channel. This means, unless there is a very good reason, we always should provide wheels through the main-label. If the release number is greater than previous releases , the package automatically becomes `latest`.

## Dev builds
Dev builds are Conda wheels, which are used for development purpose and don't appear under `latest` automatically by conda. This ensures that a Karabo installation will not be broken because of a newer version of a dependency. The naming convention is [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) compliant: `{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.dev{PATCH}`, which is automatically formed this way if the `dev` flag is set when starting a workflow. The current setup calls for the builds to have the `main` label as well. This must be compatible with the [environment.yaml](https://github.com/i4Ds/Karabo-Pipeline/blob/main/environment.yaml) of the Karabo pipeline, where they can easily be referenced.

Dev-builds can have other conda-dependencies which are also part of the Feedstock. In case you need a newer version of such a dependency, they should be a dev-build, to not create a `latest` wheel which could interfere with existing Karabo wheels. In case you want to refer to such dev-builds for building another dev-build, there is a `devDeps` option for each build which has such possible dependencies. If such an option is available, the names of each sub-dependency is comma separated (e.g. `{dep1}, {dep2}, {dep3}`) followed by a whitespace. The `dep` name must be a `build_base.yml env.{dep}` name where in the version string dev must NOT occur. The default value is to refer all sub-dependencies as dev-dependencies. *Note*: `devDeps` is only active if the `dev` flag is set, otherwise it has no effect.

**Creating new meta.yaml**: The setup relies on `packageVersionNames` in `build_base.yml`. To make the dev-setup work, you should use an `_ALT` suffix of the `packageVersionNames` in the `meta.yaml` in case you have a sub-dependency of this feedstock.

## Version Management
**Build Version Convention**: Package and dependency versions are currently defined in `build_base.yml` and in the according `meta.yaml`. At best, keep build-versions consistent with the release-versions of the package-repository. There are some cases which require a specific commit which isn't a version-tag. In that case just keep the release prior to the according commit. If no proper release management is done by the repository owner, you may have to find a custom solution to that issue. What's definitely NOT desired is to create our own custom versions and be inconsistent with the repository unless you have a very, very good reason.

**Legacy Builds**: The feedstock evolves over time. This often results in incompatible build-recipes with legacy builds. If you intend to fix such a legacy-build (for whatever reason), checkout at the according commit, create a new branch with the fixes and then trigger the build which should overwrite the broken legacy wheel.

**Constrain Dependencies**: We want to be nice to users of Karabo so they are able to install additional packages without beeing at risk to break an environment. To enable that, we should be sure to not constrain well-known dependencies like `numpy`, `scipy` or `astropy` too much if possible. On the other hand, be sure to constrain packages with a lot of api-breaking changes and exclude versions of well-known packages with known issues (for Karabo). This approach relies on a lot of testing. But since we build a lot of conda-wheels of 3th party packages, it's too cumbersome to test them individually. Therefore, the aim should be to have a high test-coverage of Karabo.

**About Build-Strings and Versions**: The uniqueness of a conda-wheel is determined by the uniqueness of the build-string and NOTHING ELSE. So if another wheel has the exact same build-string, even if it's build completely different, it would overwrite an already existing conda-wheel on [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/). This can brake package installations which depend on the accidentally removed package. So if you create a new `meta.yaml`, pay special attention to the `build` section to prevent issues. When creating a new conda build, please increase the `build-number` for each new build of the same package version, so conda knows which version to install. Build-numbers of [dev-builds](#dev-builds) have an offset of +1000 to definitely not overwrite an existing wheel even if the build-recipe is exactly the same. That means if you trigger a build-workflow with a build-number of e.g. 3 for a dev-build, the build-number will then be 1003 because of the offset.

A normal build-string for a python package (according to [conda-variants doc](https://conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/variants.html#differentiating-packages-built-with-different-variants)) looks as follows: `py{{ py }}h{{ PKG_HASH }}_{{ build }}`. We usually pin a package to a specific python version (even though it may be compatible with other python versions) to ensure compatibility of a package with a specific python version. The python version of each package is pinned in each `conda_build_config.yaml`. In case we want to support a range of python versions, where the package dependencies differ, you can define the constraints in `conda_build_config.yaml` and [zip](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/resources/variants.html#special-variant-keys) them with the python version.

Errors in the build-string can occur if they have an `-` (see [Build number and string](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/resources/define-metadata.html#build-number-and-string)). **Attention**: For some reason, the build-string of the according `meta.yaml` gets ignored in some builds and therefore the package-hash is missing in the build-string. Not sure why this is happening. There were cases where the [Host](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/resources/define-metadata.html#host) and/or the [Build](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/resources/define-metadata.html#build) section of the `meta.yaml` were corrupted (e.g. too many unnecessary tools installed) and then the build-string was not build like specified in the according `meta.yaml`. This can have a huge impact if you don't know what you're doing if you trigger a new build. If you don't set the build-number properly, it can easily overwrite an existing live-build on [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/i4Ds). This is because if a package is overwritten or not solely relies on the uniqueness of the build-string, and without the hash it just consists of the package-version and the build-number. However, if you use a dev-build, you don't have to worry (make sure that the flag is set!!!), since they have an offset of the build-number of +1000).

**Updating an already existing Wheel**: It may happen that an update of a dependency (direct or transversal) introduces a breaking change in a future release. Then, the current constraints of an existing conda-wheel is outdated an will most likely result in a broken environment. To prevent this, updating the according meta.yaml and increase the build-nr is not enough, because the solver doesn't just consider the largest build-numbers of conda-wheels. So, to fix this for current and also older releases, you have to relabel oudated conda-wheels to `legacy`. Also do a comment in the meta.yaml, why you did constrain the dependency. This makes future builds where the constraints may have to be reconsidered way easier. It was already mentioned in this paragraph, but don't forget to increase the build-number.

## About MPI

**General**: Currently, there are three different options on how a conda-wheel can be build with mpi. It's either "nompi", "openmpi" or "mpich". It seems like other packages like [h5py](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/h5py/files) include this in their build-string and so should we if we build an mpi-wheel. This makes it clear to others which packages use mpi and which mpi implementation they were built with by using `conda list | grep mpi`. The way to install mpi-wheels should be handeled by the end-user to enable maximal flexibility of a conda-wheel. This means that mpi-builds should be built with `nompi`, `mpich` and `openmpi` (using conda_build_config.yaml) & you shouldn't refer to mpi-wheel depencencies in the `meta.yaml` of the feedstock, and thus at building-time of Karabo at earliest. Be aware that openmpi nor mpich is windows-compatible. But since we don't support windows you shouldn't have to worry too much. Wheels 

**Installation of MPI-wheels**: Installation is fairly straight-forward. If there are mpi-wheels and no-mpi-wheels available, the no-mpi-wheels should chosen per default because they should have a larger build-number (offset of 100) than the mpi-wheels. If installing an mpi-build is needed (and let the dependencies figure out whether it is mpich or openmpi), just install it like the following: `conda install -c conda-forge <package>=*=mpi*`. If you want to be sure that it's mpich (or openmpi), just replace `*=mpi*` with `*=mpi_mpich*` (first asterix is to omit the version). Note that there are tools available which are based on mpi, but are not specific to it's implementation like `dask-mpi` or `mpi4py`. These tools just rely just that there is any mpi installed and therefore do not have a specific mpi-wheel.

**Using Native MPI**: There are cases where using an MPI compiled on the target architecture is needed. We don't have to consider this use-case for the feedstock since there is a solution according to [conda-forge docs](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). In this use-casee, the installer has to link the mpi of the environment to an MPI available at a standard-location as follows: `conda install "mpich=x.y.z=external_*"` or `conda install "openmpi=x.y.z=external_*"`.

External dependencies & which mpi-wheels they provide:
- [fftw](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/fftw/files): nompi, openmpi, mpich
- [h5py](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/h5py/files): nompi, openmpi, mpich
- [hdf5](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/hdf5/files): nompi, openmpi, mpich (is a dep of `h5py`)
- [casacore](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/casacore/files): nompi, openmpi

## Feedstock Build Dependencies
