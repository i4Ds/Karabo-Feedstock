# For reasons that are not entirely clear to me, conda build
# constrains the cfitsio and hdf5 run dependencies to a specific patch.
# Here, we make sure the boost / cfitsio / hdf5 combination that fits
# the Karabo environment, 1.82 / 4.3.1 / 1.14.2, is built.
# And we build more boost / cfitsio / hdf5 combinations, one for each
# boost version that is compatible with this library and its dependencies.

# Python Version Constraints: 
# The boost package, especially version 1.74, has strict compatibility requirements for Python versions (e.g., >=3.10,<3.11.0a0). This means it cannot work with Python 3.1
